# woocommerce-remove-customer-details

A WooCommerce plugin useful in situations whereby you don’t need or want to share certain customer’s data such as email, phone number or both with your dropshipper or provider.

The recipient email address (in this case dropshipper) is entered and whenever there is a new order, the sent email will not include the customer’s data that has been unchecked.
